# Reading Tracker
A different spin on the Library project in the Javascript course from <a src='https://www.theodinproject.com/' title="The Odin Project">TheOdinProject</a>, this Reading Tracker web app allows users to list and detail the books they're reading.

The app uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a Firebase Database to store the book details.

It features the ability to add and edit entries via a dialog window, as well as delete entries.
